# telegram-jung2-bot

Telegram group chat statistics bot. Tracks message counts, produces rankings, and schedules off-work reports.

## Architecture

- Go owns the HTTP webhook, SQS polling, Telegram HTTP client, DynamoDB access, command routing, statistics, settings, and report formatting.
- EventBridge Scheduler enqueues scheduled actions into SQS.
- Migration-only reference material is temporary and must be removed before the
  project is considered a standalone Go service.
- The service executable lives under `cmd/`; private Go packages live under `internal/`.
- Startup wiring lives in `cmd/main.go`; production adapters are split across
  focused internal packages instead of a single runtime package.
- Buck2 targets control build visibility.
- Buck2 builds and tests the service. Vendoring is refreshed explicitly.

## Prerequisites

- [Buck2](https://buck2.build/docs/getting_started/)
- Go 1.26+

## Commands

```bash
make install-buck2
```

Installs or upgrades Buck2 from the latest pre-built release.

```bash
make build
```

Builds the Go service with Buck2. This does not refresh vendoring.

```bash
make ci
```

Runs the full CI gate in order: `make vendor`, then `make coverage`. Since
`make coverage` depends on `make test`, and `make test` depends on `make lint`,
the effective sequence is vendoring, lint, race-enabled tests, then coverage
collection.

```bash
make test
```

Runs Buck2 tests with the race detector enabled. This does not refresh
vendoring. `make lint` runs first.

```bash
make coverage
```

Runs the Buck-built Go coverage check and fails unless `internal/` statement
coverage is 100%. It reuses the same Buck test target set and race mode as
`make test`.

```bash
make lint
```

Runs Go, shell, spelling, and Markdown lint checks.

```bash
make lint-fix
```

Applies supported lint fixes.

```bash
make vendor
```

Refreshes Go vendoring and generated vendor `BUCK` files. Run this after
dependency changes.

```bash
make clean
```

Cleans Buck2 build outputs.
